# Power-BI-FIFA-Data-Exploration
In this project I have explored the FIFA player stats of year 2022 by using Power BI. Data cleaning and manipulations are done using Power Query and data visualization is then created in Power BI.

# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Age and Height data are explored against the overall rating.

# Top Players

In this project players with rating more than 80 are considered "Top Players". They are then ranked in descending order by thier overall rating.

# Summary Stats

The averages of overall rating, height and salary are summarized against the FIFA leagues and clubs.

# Salary Changes

We now visualize the salary and overall rating changes from year 2021 and 2022 for all players.

# Positions

Each position's overall rating, height and salary is visualize.

# Overall by Country

Finally a map is created to visualize the average rating, salary, height. The colour of the map is schemed by count of players from each country (The darker tone the more the players).
